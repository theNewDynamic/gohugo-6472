Our last excerpt from the new [Poetry Pamphlets](http://ndbooks.com/book/poetry-pamphlets) series comes from Bernadette Mayer’s [_The Helens of Troy, NY_](http://ndbooks.com/book/the-helens-of-troy-new-york). To create the collection, Mayer visited, talked to, and photographed (see below) every woman named Helen living in the city of Troy, in Upstate New York.
