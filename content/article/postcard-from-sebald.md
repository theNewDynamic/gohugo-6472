Friday 2 July 1999

Dear Barbara, Thank you so much for braving the Hollywood limelight for me & for your wonderful account of the proceedings. Had I been confronted with all this I would probably have fainted on the stage or made a fool of myself in some other ways. So I am deeply in your debt. All good wishes / Ever yours Max
