TRUE CONFESSIONAL

I was conceived in the summer of Nineteen Eighteen  
when some kind of war was going on  
but it didn’t stop two people  
from making love in Ossining that year  
I like to think on a riverbank in sun  
on a picnic by the Hudson  
as in a painting of the Hudson River School  
or up at Bear Mountain maybe  
after taking the old Hudson River Line  
paddlewheel excursion steamer  
\(I may have added the paddlewheel—  
the Hudson my Mississippi)  
And on the way back she  
already carried me  
inside of her  
I lawrence ferlinghetti  
wrought from the dark in my mother long ago  
born in a small back bedroom—  
In the next room my brother heard  
the first cry,  
many years later wrote me—  
“Poor Mom—No husband—No money—Pop dead—  
How she went through it all—”  
Someone squeezed my heart  
to make it go  
I cried and sprang up  
Open eye open heart where  
do I wander  
into the heart of the world  
Carried away  
by another I knew not  
And which of me shall know my brother?  
‘I am my son, my mother, my father,  
I am born of myself  
my own flesh sucked’  
And someone squeezed my heart to make me go  
And I began to go  
through my number  
I was a wind-up toy  
someone had dropped wound-up  
into a world already  
running down  
The world had been going on  
a long time already  
but it made no difference  
It was new it was like new  
i made it new  
i saw it shining  
and it shone in the sun  
and it spun in the sun  
and the skein it spun  
was pure light  
My life was made of it  
made of the skeins of light  
The cobwebs of Night  
were not on it  
were not of it  
It was too bright  
to see  
too luminous too numinous  
to cast a shadow  
and there was another world  
behind the bright screens  
I had only to close my eyes  
for another world to appear  
too near and too dear  
to be anything but myself  
my inside self  
where everything real  
was to happen  
in this place which still exists  
inside myself  
and hasn’t changed that much  
certainly not as much  
as the outside  
with its bag of skin  
and its ‘aluminum beard’  
and its blue blue eyes  
which see as one eye  
in the middle of the head  
where everything happens  
except what happens  
in the heart  
vajra lotus diamond heart  
wherein I read  
the poem that never ends
