How fitting that an evening celebrating Muriel Spark saw a downpour so relentless that umbrellas were useless. Last night, brave Spark lovers came together to remember the writer whose cleverness and wit produced classics that include [_The Ballad of Peckham Rye_](http://ndbooks.com/book/the-ballad-of-peckham-rye1), [_The Driver’s Seat_](http://ndbooks.com/book/the-drivers-seat1), and [_Memento Mori_](http://ndbooks.com/book/memento-mori1). Leading the charge was moderator Michael Barron and panelists Barbara Epler, Emily Stokes, Maud Newton, Sadie Stein, and Thessaly LaForce.

[_The Informed Air_](http://ndbooks.com/book/the-informed-air), the first collection of Spark’s essays, edited by her friend the artist Penelope Jardine, is now available in hardcover from New Directions.

Thank you to all who attended a memorable evening of conversation and who enjoyed, in honor of Edith Sitwell, a little gin with a splash of pineapple.
