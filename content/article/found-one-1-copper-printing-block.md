As you might have heard, New Directions has been publishing books since 1936, seventy-five years. And for the last forty or so years, we’ve been in the same 19th floor space on 14th Street in Chelsea, which means that a lot our history is still here, happily reminding us of the past. Our library contains (nearly) every first edition of every book we’ve ever published, many of them well-handled and worse for the wear, but still bearing the iconic covers designed by Alvin Lustig. Our Executive Vice President has maintained a collection of (nearly) every catalog from over the years, and you could easily lose track of time leafing through their yellowing pages, delighting at seeing what James Laughlin had to say about a then-new novel by Nabokov.

And then there’s this beautiful piece of craftsmanship:

It’s a copper printing plate for the cover of the previous edition of Louis-Ferdinand Céline’s classic _Journey to the End of the Night_. I found it just sitting on one of Jeffrey Yang’s cluttered shelves. As I examined it, he explained that a few years back, a former employee had been looking to clear up space in the production manager’s office and had simply _thrown a bunch of these away_! I was speechless. Apparently the witticism is true: Nostalgia isn’t what it used to be. 

![Celine_book.jpg](https://ndbooks.imgix.net/Celine_book.jpg)To the left is a copy of a book printed using that plate. The design is by Brownjohn, Chermayeff & Geismar, and there’s a note saying that it’s "adapted from a World War I battle map of France." The rectangular hole, of course, was for the moveable typeset copy, the first line of which reads:

> Future historians, charting the disintegration of social forms in our age, will find paramount expression of this revolt in the novels of Louis-Ferdinand Céline.

So thanks to Jeffrey for saving this one. He told me that a few other employees snatched souvenirs, too, but the vast majority of them are long gone, buried in Staten Island somewhere. Alas.
