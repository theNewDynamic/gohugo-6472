Writing for [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2013/06/26/195178102/the-hare-leads-a-merry-chase), Marcela Valdes calls Aira’s [latest novel](http://ndbooks.com/book/the-hare) a "cowboy chase through the pampas in search of the white rabbit." Read it [here](http://www.npr.org/2013/06/26/195178102/the-hare-leads-a-merry-chase).
