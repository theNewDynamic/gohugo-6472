Once there was a woman  
who gave birth to a seal  
white as haar, furred like a glove.

It slid into the world  
in a rush of kelp and brine,  
moon-eyed, cold as starlight.

She wrapped it in the sea's green  
till it grew warm,  
unbending from her

a slow form uncurling   
finding pools and holes in the tide,  
rocking itself gently under.

Now, she dreams  
out on a shallow ledge,  
covered in a net of stars

singing to her child  
with the slow, full breathing   
of the ocean;

and from the hidden edges of the deep,  
a brown moan

lulling her to sleep.​
