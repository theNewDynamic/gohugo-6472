Last week, the Hungarian author sat down with Lopate in the WYNYC studio. You can listen to their conversation [here](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2012/jun/12/laszlo-krasznahorkai-emsatantangoem/), and then have a look at his cultural recommendations [here](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/articles/web-extras/2012/jun/12/guest-picks-laszlo-krasznahorkai/).
