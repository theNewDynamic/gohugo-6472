To celebrate our great poet and friend, we dipped into the New Directions editorial files and found correspondence about _A Coney Island of the Mind_ (first published in 1958) between Lawrence and the late New Directions publisher, Griselda Ohannessian.

Birthday celebrations are happening in San Francisco and all over the country this weekend.  
[Visit the City Lights website for all the details. ](http://www.citylights.com/ferlinghetti/)

Happy Birthday, Lawrence! 100 years young.

Love,  
New Directions
