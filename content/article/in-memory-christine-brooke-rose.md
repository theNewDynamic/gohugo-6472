Christine Brooke-Rose, the prominent English critic and experimental writer, died on March 21 at the age of 89. Brooke-Rose was born in Switzerland and educated at Somerville College in Oxford and University College in London. She taught English literature at the University of Paris from 1968 to 1988. Brooke-Rose’s writing ranged from literary criticism to short stories,, but she is perhaps best known for her experimental novels, and the techniques of constraint she used to employ writing them (i.e. writing an entire novel without using the verb "to be.") In 1992, New Directions published Brooke-Rose’s _[Textermination](http://ndbooks.com/book/textermination) — _a novel about a gathering of famous literary characters at a San Francisco Hitlon who ponder their continued existence in the minds of contemporary readers.
