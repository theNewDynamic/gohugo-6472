If you haven’t had the pleasure of seeing [László Krasznahorkai](http://ndbooks.com/author/laszlo-krasznahorkai) read from _[AnimalInside](http://ndbooks.com/book/animalinside)_ in a darkened room, illuminated by Max Neumann’s "dog-beast" paintings, we recommend you watch this video.

Here [Forrest Gander](http://ndbooks.com/author/forrest-gander) and Krasznahorkai take turns reading from the book at Brown University, April 2014.
