> A little movement stirs the linen,

> The sky is halfway still, half wild;
> half it is involved with cloud,
> half stepping brightly out in blue.
> Already the sun has been forgotten
> and all the world is making ready
> to disappear into a garden
> which is evening; white the linen
> stirs in a gentle wind, the evening
> wind, does it make a sort of linen
> airily also stir in me?
> I don't believe so. Quiet night
> has just become entirely sovereign.
> The breeze in me now stirs no more.

New Directions mourns the loss of our friend, the wonderful poet and translator, Christopher Middleton.

"He is an incomparable stylist, a wry ironist, a philosopher of words. The only category in which he fits justly is that of poet."—Guy Davenport

We share the sorrow of his family, friends, readers, and admirers—and we take solace in the beautiful work he has left for us.
