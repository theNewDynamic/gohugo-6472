**_Be With_ by Forrest Gander wins the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry**

New Directions is overjoyed by the news that our poet, translator, and dear friend Forrest Gander—whom we first published in 1998—has won this year's Pulitzer Prize!

Read "Epitaph" from _Be With_ below.

Congratulations, Forrest! We are so happy for you!

Love, New Directions

**EPITAPH**

To write _You_

_existed me_

would not be merely

a deaf translation.

For there is no

sequel to the passage when

I saw—_as you would_

_never again_

_be revealed_—you see me

_as I would never_

_again be revealed_.

Where I stand now

before the throne of

glory, the script

must remain hidden. Where,

but in the utterance itself?

Born halt and

blind, hooped-in by

obligations, aware

of the stare of

the animal inside, I

hide behind mixed

instrumentalities

as behind a square

of crocodile scute—

while cyanide drifts

from clouds to

the rivers. And in this

too might be seen

a figuration

of the human,

another intimately

lethal gesture of our

common existence.

Though I also wear

my life into death, the

ugliness I originate

outlives me.
