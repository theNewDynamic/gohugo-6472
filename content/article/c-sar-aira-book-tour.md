Thank you to everyone who made it to César Aira's first ever US events in New York and Washington DC. For those of you who couldn't be there, a photo essay of his NYC events: with Hari Kunzru at Greenlight Bookstore (with surprise guest appearance from Cecil Taylor), Sergio Chejfec and Moníca de la Torre at the Cervantes Institute, and Rivka Galchen at McNally Jackson.
