On January 23, translators Idra Novey and Johnny Lorenz, along with ND Publisher Barbara Epler and host Sal Robinson, read from and discussed the new translations of [Clarice Lispector](http://ndbooks.com/author/clarice-lispector)’s work. The Center for Fiction recorded the event, and you can watch it [here](http://www.centerforfiction.org/calendar/new-directions-for-clarice-lispector/).
