David Annand, writing for [_Telegraph UK_](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/fictionreviews/9635963/Lightning-Rods-by-Helen-DeWitt-review.html), states that, "Helen Dewitt’s _Lightning Rods_ finally takes its place alongside her brilliant debut _The Last Samurai _and her narrative-disassembling online novel _Your Name Here _to form the basis of an oeuvre that will, one hopes, be recognised in the future as one of the most interesting of its time."
